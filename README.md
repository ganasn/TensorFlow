# TensorFlow
Learning TensorFlow from https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/

Objective: In 30 days, learn TensorFlow as much from aforementioned website and then move to books on TF

Day-1: Aug 30, 2017 
Actual: Browse basic TF materials and identify resources 

Day-2: Aug 31, 2017
Actual: Installed Python 3.5.2 and TF. Commenced 'Get Started'

Day-3: Sep 1, 2017
Planned: Complete 'Get Started' and commence 'MNIST for Beginners'
Actual: Partially completed 'Get Started'

Day-4: Sep 7, 2017
Planned: Complete 'Get Started' and commence 'MNIST for Beginners'
Actual: Made some progress on 'Get Started' but yet to complete
Comments: Beginning to weigh in options between learning languages with a side of algorithms versus a domain-specific application using TensorFlow that already uses a familiar language (Python.) In addition to these, there is also tests, build, deploy, etc. that come along with actually using whatever that's built. Need to understand the value of laboring over TensorFlow.
